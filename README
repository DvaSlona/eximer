                  README - Virtual Exim
		  =====================

Thanks for picking the Virtual Exim package, for your Exim mail hosting
needs :-)

This readme should be a nice step by step walk-through of how to set up
VExim on your machine. There are a few requirements (listed below), and
it is expected that you have *a little* knowledge of both MySQL and
Exim.

Before we go into any details, I'd like to thanks Philip Hazel and the
Exim developers for a fine fine product.
I would also like to thanks the postmasters at various domains for
letting me play havoc with their mail while I set this up :-)
Finally, a special note of thanks to Dan Bernstein for his Qmail MTA.
Dan, thank you for educating me how mail delivery really shouldn't be
done, on an Internet level.


Requirements:
The following packages must be installed on your system, for VExim to
work:
    * Exim v4 compiled against mysql (tested on v3.23.x/v4.1x/4.2x)
    * Mysql (tested on v3.23.x/v4.0.x/4.1x/4.2x)
    * Apache (Tested in 1.3.27)
    * PHP v4 (tested on v4.3.x)
    This might work on older versions of MySQL
    This should work on versions of PHP back to 4.2.1, but not older
    (due to the use of global variables like $_POST[]).
    I have no idea about older versions of Exim, as I've never used
    them myself. You can try though if you know the configure file.
    Unless the bug which prevents you setting multiple cookies, in
    Apache 2 has been resolved, this won't work on Apache 2.
    

Installation steps for each component:

NOTE FOR UPGRADING:
  If you are upgrading from a previous version of Virtual Exim, please
  read the file "UPGRADING". Do not follow the installation instructions
  in this file!


PARTS:
  Files and Apache
  Exim configuration
  MySQL
  Site Admin
  Virtual Domains
  Mailman
  Mail storage and Delivery
  POP3 and IMAP daemons (separate to this software)


Files and Apache:
  In this distribution is a directory called 'vexim'. Move this to
  where ever you keep your domains with Apache. Then set up a virtual
  host, and point it's DocumentRoot at the vexim directory.
  Although a virtual host shouldn't be *required*, the way I have the
  code set up right now, it is. It seems to make things simple and work
  :-) I'm sure I can make it not be a requirement. I'll work on it for
  the next version.

Exim configuration:
  An example exim 'configure' file, has been included with this
  distribution.
  The following lines are important and will need to be edited if you
  are using this configure, or copied to your own configure:

    MAILMAN_HOME=/usr/local/mailman
    MAILMAN_WRAP=MAILMAN_HOME/mail/mailman
    *** Edit these if your mailman is in a different location.

    MAILMAN_USER=mailnull
    MAILMAN_GROUP=mail
    *** These need to match the username and group under which exim runs

    primary_hostname=mail.silverwraith.com
    *** This is my mail server. There are many like it, but this one is
    mine. Make this like yours.

    domainlist local_domains = silverwraith.com : mail.silverwraith.com
    domainlist relay_to_domains =                                     
    hostlist   relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1 : 66.214.182.79 
    *** These control which domains you accept mail for and deliver
    locally (local_domains), which domains you accept mail for and
    deliver remotely (relay_to_domains), and which IP addresses are
    allowed to send mail to any domain.

    exim_user = mailnull
    exim_group = mail
    *** Specify here, the username and group under which Exim runs. This
    combination is also that under which mailman must run in order to
    work.

    hide mysql_servers = localhost::(/tmp/mysql.sock)/exim/exim/CHANGE
    *** This is the line the configures mysql connectivity. We will use
    mysql which runs on the local server, rather than a remote server,
    so that we can connect over a UNIX domain socket (much nicer). You
    need to change the word 'CHANGE' at the end, to the password you
    supplied on the GRANT line on mysql.sql.

MySQL and Authentication:
  Needs to be installed. A script is included (mysql.sql) which will
  create the database and table for you. Two things you need to do, are
  edit the mysql.sql file and set a password. This password is set on
  line 13 of mysql.sql (which starts 'GRANT'...)
  You also need to know, if your system uses DES or MD5 password
  encryption. BSD and Linux normally use MD5, whereas Solaris systems
  commonly use the older style DES.
  Uncomment the appropriate line, as noted by the comments, at the end
  of mysql.sql.
  After updating the mysql.sql file, run:
    mysql -u root -p < mysql.sql
  The password you are prompted for when doing this should be your MySQL
  database's root user password.
  Also it is assumed that the mysql domain socket is /tmp/mysql.sock,
  which is where the FreeBSD port puts it. Other installations put it in
  /var/tmp, /usr/lib, or any number of other places. If yours isn't
  /tmp/mysql.sock, you will later need to set this in Exim's configure
  script.
  Finally, you will need to edit:
    mysql/mysql_connect.php
  and change the MySQL exim user's password there too. Set this to the
  same as the password you put in mysql.sql. It needs to be changed on
  the second line where the word 'CHANGE' is.

  You also need to edit the file mysql/variables.php, and set the crypt
  type to either "md5" or "des". What you choose is not optional. It
  must be the same as your operating system's crypt libraries use.

Site Admin:
  In order to add and delete domains from the database, you need to have
  a "site admin". This users can create the initial postmaster users for
  the individual domains.
  The default username and password for the siteadmin, are:
  Username: siteadmin
  Password: CHANGE
  The password is case sensitive.
  I recommend you log in and change this when you get a chance :-)

Virtual Domains:
  At present, domains that Exim will accept mail for, need to be
  specified in the configure file. This will be moved to the MySQL
  database when I figure out how to do it, but for now that's how we
  need to do it.

Mailman:
  Needs to be installed if you want to use mailing lists. The default
  location is assumed to be /usr/local/mailman. If this is not the
  location of your installation,
  edit Exim's configure file, and change the paths where ever 'mailman'
  is mentioned.

Mail storage and Delivery:
  The mysql configuration assumes that mail will be stored in
  /usr/local/mail/domain.com/username/Maildir. If you want to change the
  path from '/usr/local/mail', you need to edit the file:
    mysql/variables.php
  and change 'mailroot' to the correct path. Don't forget the / at the
  end.

  By default all users who are added, will be given a uid and gid of
  '90' in the database. These are just what I use on my system. You need
  to create a username and a group under this UID and GID on your
  operating system. Exim will use these to do the actual mail delivery.
  Currently all mail boxes share the same UID and GID. This isn't a real
  problem in a virtual setting. If you want to use something other than
  '90', edit the file:
    mysql/variables.php
  and change them there before creating the user. The name of the user
  with this UID and GID can be anything, as long as the UID and GID on
  the system are consistent with those in the config files.


POP3 and IMAP daemons:
  There are many POP3 and IMAP daemons available today. Few of them are
  good, and fewer of those like MySQL. Two that we have found that work
  are:
      POP3 Only:         Qpopper
      IMAP and/or POP3:  The Courier-IMAP package
  Instructions for installing these have been included in this tarball
  in the following files:
      Qpopper:       docs/clients/qpop-mysql.txt
      Courier-IMAP:  docs/clients/freebsd-courierimap.txt (FreeBSD HOWTO)
  These documents are pretty clear and you should be able to use them as
  a template when compiling from source on most Unixes. Just remember
  the switches on 'configure' scripts for enabling mysql support :-)

  Instructions for configuring Cyrus and Cyrus IMAP are also available. However, we have not tested
  these so cannot guarantee they work. If you have success or problems with these instructions,
  please let us know!
