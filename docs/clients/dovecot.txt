Configuring Dovecot to work with Virtual Exim

  This short manual is based on my experience setting up Dovecot 1.2.15
  to work with Vexim under Debian 6.0 (Squeeze). Any additions or
  improvements to this document are very welcome.

  Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like
  systems, written with security primarily in mind.

  Setting Dovecot up to work with Vexim is indeed rather trivial:

1. Edit /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf. It is documented rather extensively
   on Debian, so I won't go through everything. For Vexim auth to work,
   you can comment out the `passdb pam' block, and uncomment the
   `passdb sql` one instead. My `passdb sql' looks like this:

      passdb sql {
        # Path for SQL configuration file
        args = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf
      }

   I have also uncommented the `userdb prefetch' block:

      userdb prefetch {
      }

2. Edit /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf. Again, it is well documeted,
   so I won't go into detail. With comments stripped out, my file
   looks like following:

      driver = mysql
      connect = host=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock dbname=vexim user=vexim password=CHANGE
      default_pass_scheme = CRYPT
      password_query = \
        SELECT `username` AS `user`, `crypt` AS `password`, \
          `pop` AS `userdb_home`, `uid` AS `userdb_uid`, `gid` AS `userdb_gid` \
        FROM `users` WHERE `username` = '%u'

3. There's no step 3! Just restart Dovecot, and it should work.
