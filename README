                         Virtual Exim 2
		             README
		           ==========

Thanks for picking the Virtual Exim package, for your virtual mail
hosting needs :-)

This readme should be a nice step by step walk-through of how to set up
Virtual Exim on your machine. There are a few requirements (listed
below), and it is expected that you have *a little* knowledge of both
MySQL and Exim.

Before we go into any details, I'd like to thanks Philip Hazel and the
Exim developers for a fine product.
I would also like to thanks the postmasters at various domains for
letting me play havoc with their mail while I set this up :-)
Finally, a special note of thanks to Dan Bernstein for his Qmail MTA.
Dan, thank you for educating me how mail delivery really shouldn't be
done, on the Internet.


Requirements:
The following packages must be installed on your system, for VExim to
work:
    * Exim v4 compiled against mysql (tested on v3.23.x/v4.1x/4.2x)
    * Mysql (tested on v3.23.x/v4.0.x/4.1x/4.2x)
      or PostgreSQL (tested on x7.3.x)
    * Apache (Tested in 1.3.27)
    * PHP v4 (tested on v4.3.x)
    * Perl + DBI module for creating the databases (optional)
    * Perl DBD-mysql or DBD-Pg modules for creating databases (optional)
    This might work on older versions of MySQL or PostgreSQL.
    This should work on versions of PHP back to 4.2.1, but not older
    (due to the use of global variables like $_POST[]).
    I have no idea about older versions of Exim, as I've never used
    them myself. You can try though if you know the configure file.
    You can create the MySQL or PostgreSQL databases without the perl
    script if you want, but if you are upgrading from MySQL to
    PostgreSQL.


Installation steps for each component:

NOTE FOR UPGRADING:
  If you are upgrading from a previous version of Virtual Exim, please
  read the file "UPGRADING". Do not follow the installation instructions
  in this file!


PARTS:
  Files and Apache
  Exim configuration
  MySQL
  Site Admin
  Virtual Domains
  Mailman
  Mail storage and Delivery
  POP3 and IMAP daemons (separate to this software)


Files and Apache:
  In this distribution is a directory called 'vexim'.
  You have two options:
    1) Copy this directory into your current DocumentRoot for your
       domain, and optionally rename the directory.
    2) Set up a new VirtualHost and point the DocumentRoot to the vexim
       directory.
  Both should work equally well.


Exim configuration:
  An example exim 'configure' file, has been included with this
  distribution.
  The following lines are important and will need to be edited if you
  are using this configure, or copied to your own configure:

    MAILMAN_HOME=/usr/local/mailman
    MAILMAN_WRAP=MAILMAN_HOME/mail/mailman
    *** Edit these if your mailman is in a different location.
----------
    MAILMAN_USER=mailnull
    MAILMAN_GROUP=mail
    *** These need to match the username and group under which exim runs
----------
    primary_hostname=mail.silverwraith.com
    *** This is my mail server. There are many like it, but this one is
    mine. Make this like yours.
----------
    # If you are using MySQL, uncomment the following two lines:
    #VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(domain, ' : ') FROM domains type = 'local'
    #RELAY_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(domain, ' : ') FROM domains type = 'relay'
    -----
    # If you are using PGSQL, uncomment the following four lines:
    #VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT domain || ' : ' FROM domains WHERE type = 'local'
    #RELAY_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT domain || ' : ' FROM domains WHERE type = 'relay'
    *** Depending on the database type you are using, you will need to
    uncomment the appropriate lines in the config, to enable lookups.
----------
    hostlist   relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1 : 66.214.182.79 
    *** These control which domains you accept mail for and deliver
    locally (local_domains), which domains you accept mail for and
    deliver remotely (relay_to_domains), and which IP addresses are
    allowed to send mail to any domain.
----------
    exim_user = mailnull
    exim_group = mail
    *** Specify here, the username and group under which Exim runs. This
    combination is also that under which mailman must run in order to
    work.
----------
    # av_scanner = clamd:/tmp/clamd
    # spamd_address = 127.0.0.1 783
    *** If you want to use either Anti-Virus scanning, or SpamAssassin, you
    will need to uncomment the appropriate line here.
----------
    #hide mysql_servers = localhost::(/tmp/mysql.sock)/vexim/vexim/CHANGE
    #hide pgsql_servers = localhost/vexim/vexim/CHANGE
    *** These lines configure database connectivity. You need to
    uncomment the one that is appropriate for you; the first if you are
    using mysql, or the second if you are using postgresql.
    You need to change the word 'CHANGE', to the password you will use
    for the 'vexim' database user, which we will set up in the next
    part.
----------
    acl_check_content
    *** You *MUST* review this section of the ACL's. Decide here if some
    of the default settings (like defang_mime, and the unwanted
    attachments) are appropriate for you or not. I have set this ACL up
    to do the appropriate lookups in the database, to see if individual
    users have requested Anti-Virus or SpamAssassin be used.
----------
    #acl_check_data:
    #  deny    message       = This message contains a virus: ($malware_name)
    #          demime        = *
    #          malware       = *
    # 
    #  accept
    *** If you are using either SpamAssassin, or Anti-Virus checking,
    you need to uncomment these lines.
----------
    Finally if you are using PostgreSQL instead of MySQL, change all
    references of 'mysql' to 'pgsql'. The following vi command will do
    the trick:
    :%s/mysql/pgsql/g


Databases and Authentication:
  Needs to be installed. A script is included (mysql.sql) which will
  create the database and table for you. Two things you need to do, are
  edit the mysql.sql file and set a password. This password is set on
  line 13 of mysql.sql (which starts 'GRANT'...)
  You also need to know, if your system uses DES or MD5 password
  encryption. BSD and Linux normally use MD5, whereas Solaris systems
  commonly use the older style DES.
  Uncomment the appropriate line, as noted by the comments, at the end
  of mysql.sql.
  After updating the mysql.sql file, run:
    mysql -u root -p < mysql.sql
  The password you are prompted for when doing this should be your MySQL
  database's root user password.
  Also it is assumed that the mysql domain socket is /tmp/mysql.sock,
  which is where the FreeBSD port puts it. Other installations put it in
  /var/tmp, /usr/lib, or any number of other places. If yours isn't
  /tmp/mysql.sock, you will later need to set this in Exim's configure
  script.
  Finally, you will need to edit:
    mysql/mysql_connect.php
  and change the MySQL exim user's password there too. Set this to the
  same as the password you put in mysql.sql. It needs to be changed on
  the second line where the word 'CHANGE' is.

  You also need to edit the file mysql/variables.php, and set the crypt
  type to either "md5" or "des". What you choose is not optional. It
  must be the same as your operating system's crypt libraries use.

Site Admin:
  In order to add and delete domains from the database, you need to have
  a "site admin". This users can create the initial postmaster users for
  the individual domains.
  The default username and password for the siteadmin, are:
  Username: siteadmin
  Password: CHANGE
  The password is case sensitive.
  I recommend you log in and change this when you get a chance :-)

Virtual Domains:
  At present, domains that Exim will accept mail for, need to be
  specified in the configure file. This will be moved to the MySQL
  database when I figure out how to do it, but for now that's how we
  need to do it.

Mailman:
  Needs to be installed if you want to use mailing lists. The default
  location is assumed to be /usr/local/mailman. If this is not the
  location of your installation,
  edit Exim's configure file, and change the paths where ever 'mailman'
  is mentioned.

Mail storage and Delivery:
  The mysql configuration assumes that mail will be stored in
  /usr/local/mail/domain.com/username/Maildir. If you want to change the
  path from '/usr/local/mail', you need to edit the file:
    mysql/variables.php
  and change 'mailroot' to the correct path. Don't forget the / at the
  end.

  By default all users who are added, will be given a uid and gid of
  '90' in the database. These are just what I use on my system. You need
  to create a username and a group under this UID and GID on your
  operating system. Exim will use these to do the actual mail delivery.
  Currently all mail boxes share the same UID and GID. This isn't a real
  problem in a virtual setting. If you want to use something other than
  '90', edit the file:
    mysql/variables.php
  and change them there before creating the user. The name of the user
  with this UID and GID can be anything, as long as the UID and GID on
  the system are consistent with those in the config files.


POP3 and IMAP daemons:
  There are many POP3 and IMAP daemons available today. Few of them are
  good, and fewer of those like MySQL. Two that we have found that work
  are:
      POP3 Only:         Qpopper
      IMAP and/or POP3:  The Courier-IMAP package
  Instructions for installing these have been included in this tarball
  in the following files:
      Qpopper:       docs/clients/qpop-mysql.txt
      Courier-IMAP:  docs/clients/freebsd-courierimap.txt (FreeBSD HOWTO)
  These documents are pretty clear and you should be able to use them as
  a template when compiling from source on most Unixes. Just remember
  the switches on 'configure' scripts for enabling mysql support :-)

  Instructions for configuring Cyrus and Cyrus IMAP are also available. However, we have not tested
  these so cannot guarantee they work. If you have success or problems with these instructions,
  please let us know!
      Cyrus:         docs/clients/cyrus.txt
