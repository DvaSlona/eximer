# add vexim group to an existing vexim setup

    - run create table statement for groups
    - in your exim configure just before virtual_domains_catchall add
          .include /usr/exim/vexim-group-router.conf

# Things to do :

major

    - translation
    - the create SQL statement are missing for postgres and create_db.pl

minor

    - find a way to garbage members (user or alias) of a group that has been deleted
    - improvment : could add spam processing and virus checking at the group level
    - improvment : it is not possible to add member that is not a alias nor a user  
                   if you want to put a group in a group the work around is to create 
                       an alias for the internal group
                   if you want to add a member that is not a user or an alias in the
                       domain the work around is to create an alias for this user

trivial

    - when added the same user twice there is no clean error message
    - a confirmation message is missing when removing a member from a group
    - move information messages to config/header.php
